# tdd-tutorial
A simple Test Driven Development project using NodeJS and Chai

To run:
* npm install
* mocha ./test --recursive --watch

It should load the tests and begin with all but one failing. As you make updates to app/tdd-tutorial.js and save, the tests should update as well.
Use the descriptions from the unit tests to determine what is missing.
